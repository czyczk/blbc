/// # History
///
/// And Saint Attila raised the `SmallVec` up on high, saying, "O Lord, bless this Thy `SmallVec`
/// that, with it, Thou mayest blow Thine allocation costs to tiny bits in Thy mercy."
///
/// And the Lord did grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies
/// and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large chu...
///
/// And the Lord spake, saying, "First shalt thou depend on the [`smallvec`](https://crates.io/crates/smallvec) crate.
/// Then, shalt thou keep three inline. No more. No less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt keep inline,
/// and the number to keep inline shalt be three. Four shalt thou not keep inline, nor either keep inline
/// thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three,
/// being the third number, be reached, then, lobbest thou thy `SmallVec` towards thy heap, who,
/// being slow and cache-naughty in My sight, shall snuff it."
///
/// # Why Three
///
/// `StaticVec` is used frequently to keep small lists of items in inline (non-heap) storage in
/// order to improve cache friendliness and reduce indirections.
///
/// The number 3, other than being the holy number, is carefully chosen for a balance between
/// storage space and reduce allocations. That is because most function calls (and most functions,
/// for that matter) contain fewer than 4 arguments, the exception being closures that capture a
/// large number of external variables.
///
/// In addition, most script blocks either contain many statements, or just one or two lines;
/// most scripts load fewer than 4 external modules; most module paths contain fewer than 4 levels
/// (e.g. `std::collections::map::HashMap` is 4 levels and it is just about as long as they get).
